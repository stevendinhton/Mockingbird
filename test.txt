RuneScape is a fantasy MMORPG developed and published by Jagex, released originally in January 2001. RuneScape can be used as a graphical browser game implemented on the client-side in Java, and incorporates 3D rendering. Since the release of the NXT client in April 2016, a non-browser based version of the game that is written in C++ is also available. The game has had over 200 million accounts created and is recognised by the Guinness World Records as the world's largest free MMORPG and the most-updated game. RuneScape takes place in the world of Gielinor, a medieval fantasy realm divided into different kingdoms, regions, and cities. Players can travel throughout Gielinor via a number of methods including on foot, magical spells, or charter ships. Each region offers different types of monsters, resources, and quests to challenge players. Players are represented in the game with customisable avatars. RuneScape does not follow a linear storyline; rather, players set their own goals and objectives. Players can choose to fight non-player character (NPC) monsters, complete quests, or increase their experience in the available skills. Players interact with each other through trading, chatting, or by participating in mini-games and activities, some of which are competitive or combative in nature, while others require cooperative or collaborative play. The first public version of RuneScape was released on 4 January 2001 in beta form, and in December 2001, Jagex was formed to manage the game. As the game's popularity grew, the game engine was rewritten, and its beta was opened to paying players on 1 December 2003 under the name RuneScape 2, and officially released on 29 March 2004. The game is very similar to its predecessor in terms of gameplay, it is mostly set in a series of 3D battle arenas mostly modeled after notable locations in the Dragon Ball universe, with the central hub being an expanded version of Toki-Toki City, called Conton City. As reported by the creators of the Game, Conton City will be 7-times larger than Toki-Toki City. Players are able to freely traverse this new hub world, and in some areas are even capable of flying around, however this feature will not be available from start, instead being unlocked. Players will also be able to travel to other hubs such as the Namekian Village and Frieza's ship. Some skills will have to be learned through masters, like the previous game. However, some masters will be found exclusively in these extra hubs. Xenoverse 2 will be the fourth Dragon Ball video game to feature character customization. Players are able to choose from the five races of the first game: Humans, Saiyans, Majins, Namekians and Frieza's race. The game also features race-specific quests, minigames and transformations (the latter of which was only available to Saiyans in the first game, via the Super Saiyan forms). Players also have a much greater role in the story, as some decisions will have to be made by them. Multiplayer servers are now able to hold up to 300 players at once. The game also has a training mode called Training School, and when customising a character, there is the option to choose different kinds of ki blasts (Power, Burst, Freeze, Rush, Paralyze and Bomb).
